## Gym Routine & Fitness Plan

First off, big thanks to my colleague who got me started with a strength-training plan after I very subtly mentioned (several times) that I had no idea what I was doing in the gym and could really use some advice. He built me an initial plan, which I'm altering here, tailoring it to try to fit my fitness goals, which are:

1. Support my return to distance running post long-term injury-related hiatus
2. Get cut af

I'm cataloging the plan here for posterity, ease of access & sharing, and as a contrived way of adding in some extra personal accountability. Also I'm really excited about finally feeling ready to return to running seriously, and writing-up my plan is my way of thinking through how I want to approach the training.

### General Ideas

- Injury avoidance over maximizing output (or _"how many times do we have to teach you the same lesson old man!?_")
- Consider (undogmatically) the 80/20 concept.
- For gym sessions: days off between upper and lower body sessions can be inserted, but are not crucial. Coordinate muscle group activities around planned key running "workouts" (Wednesday Workout, Sunday Long Run).
- Gym sessions are split into two muscle groups: "Upper" and "Lower body." The key is to **hit each muscle group roughly twice a week**.
- For weekly scheduling I've tried to keep "hard days hard and easy days easy." In the "rebuild" phase, I am prioritizing two **full** days off a week.

On "stacking" days:
There is an idea that by doing the gym sessions on the "workout" days, I'll be challenging fatigued muscles and therefore increasing adaptation. Let's see how this works. Remaining pragmatic and focusing on an achievable schedule that does not explode my work/life balance is also important. I'll leave the "I don't do anything else other than run, train, and recover" for the times when the training plan is peaking pre-races (optimistically assuming I'll ever get back there!).

### 🦵 Lower Body – Rotation 1

- **Glutes**: Hip thrust
- **Hamstrings/Glutes**: Romanian deadlifts
- **Quads**: Leg extensions
- **Adductors**: Adductor machine
- **Calves**:
  - Weighted toe walk
  - Soleus Raise in Bulgarian Split Squat hold (_[reference](https://youtu.be/2CcnMcCNURk?si=cCdoz7uQvD3owUFO&t=395)_)
- **Gluteus Medius** (_[reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwPe0JwYbrA&t=125s)_) 
  - Side-lying abduction
  - Pelvic drop
  - Single-leg deadlift
  - Single-leg squat
  - Side bridge

> On the power of the gluteus medius:
>
> When I was in college, all my power came from my calves. It injured me all the time and was a big obstacle. As I got older, my form got better; all the power comes from the quads, hips, and glutes. When you’re fatigued there, you know you’re running well. Keep up with those glute med exercises; keeping that muscle activated is the best thing you can do to continuously progress in your mechanics/efficiency.
>
> -- _wisdom from my running coach_

### 💪 Upper Body – Rotation 1

- **Chest**: Bench press, dumbbells, incline Smith press — pick one and be consistent  
- **Lateral Raises**: Any variant (dumbbells, cables)  
- **Lat Pulldowns**: Or any pulling motion in the frontal plane (pulling top-down) to target the lats  
- **Triceps**: Single-arm pushdowns on cable machine (biases the long head)  
- **Biceps**: Dumbbell curls or preacher curls (machine)

### 🦵 Lower Body – Rotation 2

- **Hamstrings**: Leg curls (seated preferred, lying also okay)
- **Quads**: Squat-type movement or leg press
- **Quads/Glutes**: Bulgarian split squats
- **Calves**:
  - Extended-leg calf raises on machine or leg press.
    - Focus on the stretch and depth. Get to 90° between shin and foot on the concentric. No need to fully extend ankle.
  - Eccentric calf raise w/ kettleball.
- **Core & Hip Flexors** (2x 15-20 ea.)
  - single leg bridge (hits glutes, works hip stability, adds lower back injury prevention by activating posterior chain)
  - glute kick back (glutes, hamstrings, more hip stability)
  - dead bug (core activation)
  - fire hydrants (hip abductors)
  - oblique press
  - plank (3x60)

### 💪 Upper Body – Rotation 2

- **Chest**: Flys on pec deck  
- **Shoulders**: Pressing movement — seated dumbbells, military press, Smith machine  
  - Shoulder press is the builder; lateral raises are complementary  
- **Back**: Low row or any sagittal plane pulling (pulling toward you)  
  - Machines preferred, barbell row is okay  
- **Triceps**: Dip machine, dips, close-grip bench press, tricep extension machine  
- **Biceps**: Hammer curls

### 🔁 Working Sets & Progression

All the science here is:

- “The weight ain’t gonna lift itself.”
- “Let’s try to minimize fatigue.”

#### Key Principles

- Goal: **Progressively get stronger** (strength and muscle size are highly correlated).
- Avoid **training to failure** — it causes more muscle damage than benefit.

#### Set Structure Examples

All listed exercise are intended as **2 working sets of 7–8 reps**, unless otherwise specified. As many **warm-up sets** as needed can be added before the working sets.

**Option 1: Drop Weight on 2nd Set**

    1st Set: 100 kg @ 7 reps, 1 RIR (Rep In Reserve)  
    2nd Set: 90 kg @ ~7 reps, target 1 RIR

**Option 2: Drop Reps on 2nd Set**

    1st Set: 100 kg @ 7 reps, 1–2 RIR  
    2nd Set: 100 kg @ 4–6+ reps, 0–1 RIR

#### Progression Method: "Double Progression"

**Next session:**

    100 kg @ 8 reps, same RIR  

**After that:**  

    102.5 kg @ 7 reps, with 1 RIR

#### ⏱️ Pauses Between Sets

- ~~2–3 minutes~~ **1-2 min.** between working sets (I've got the endurance from all that running, might as well save some time.)
- Goal: Get my breathing (roughly) back to normal before starting again

#### 🕒 Time-Saving Tips

- Superset **biceps and triceps**: alternate them with short pauses
- Superset **mobility** work between heavier leg-day sets (e.g. eccentric calf raises between leg press)
- No pauses between warm-up sets — they’re just for prep.  
  - Keep warm-up rest short  
  - Only take a longer rest before the **first working set**

## 🗓 Weekly Activity Calendar

You can view the full version of my Google Sheets [training plan][training-plan] to see how this translates to my actual weekly activities.

(_As seen in the image at the start of the post_)

### Phase 0: "Rebuild"

Recover a stable foundation with a solid, but still conservative load.
Prioritize consistent work at a "base pace." The goal here is: time on feet.
The _Sunday Long Run_ is the main event of the week with the focus on regaining the endurance that's been lost (runs >80 min. are the primary endurance builder.)

#### Running

- Target 40km/week at start with a 16km Long Run.
- Increase volume by ~15% every 3 weeks of issue-free running. 
- Suggested activity distance ranges allow this block to build up from a 40km to 60km volume with 4 days/week running.
- Speed-work here is _very light_, a few strides once or twice a week, a light fartlek, etc.
- Consider a down week every 4-5 weeks. (Down week: 20-30% reduction of volume across the board, quality stays the same.)

#### Gym

- Enjoy a general "get ripped" phase during this low volume running period. Hit muscle groups 2x/week.
- Don't skimp on the supportive leg strengthening (gluteus medius, tibialis, soleus).

## Future Phases

I'll leave these details out until I'm actually ready to shift to the next phase. For now just a sneak peak: 

### Phase 1: "Build"

> This is the phase where you're laying the foundation for future harder work

### Phase 2: "Strength"

> This is the phase where we begin doing more intensive work that is aiming at broad adaptation & generally getting faster

> -- _Ancient Chavi wisdom_

### Phase 3: _Goal Specific Work_

Assuming all goes well for the next 6-8 months, let's see if a 2026 springtime marathon is possible!
