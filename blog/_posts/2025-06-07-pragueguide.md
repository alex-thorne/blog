# Prague Recommendations / Info

For years I've been gradually updating an email that I modify and resend to friends and family when they ask for recommendations when visiting Prague. I'm posting it here now for easier sharing.
The list is highly opinionated and by absolutely no means comprehensive or even very well informed. Maybe one day it will be slightly more informative. Maybe not.

## Getting around in Prague  

### Public Transit

Public transit in Prague is extremely efficient: you can cross the city in under an hour. Regular services run until around midnight, much less frequent night routes are available after midnight.  

- **Timetables & routes:** [DPP Transport Around Prague](http://www.dpp.cz/en/transport-around-prague/)  
- **App for tickets:** [PID Lítačka](https://app.pidlitacka.cz/). Don't forget to "activate" your purchased tickets when you actually need to use them! 
- **Google Maps:** Works very well for route planning within the city.
- **[Mapy.cz](https://mapy.com/):** the best map option for the Czech Republic, especially for tourist trails.
- **City Bikes** [Rekola](https://www.rekola.cz/en/) and [nextbike](https://www.nextbike.de/en/) are the primary options for short term bike rentals. I think it's a great way to get around Prague. Ride safely - use mapy.cz for the best bike routes.

### Ridesharing Apps & Taxis

Uber and Wolt operate in Prague and work reliably. They are typically cheaper than standard taxis. Standard taxi cabs have a bad reputation for trying to rip off tourists. I would generally recommend simply avoiding them.

# Sightseeing & Highlights  

Grouped by area. Again, definitely **not** a comprehensive guide.

## Malá Strana  

Malá Strana (“Small Town”) is the historic district nestled between the river and the hills of the Prague Castle and Petřín.
It's home to the Prague Castle (the seat of the Czech President and an active working facility), Strakova akademie (office of the Prime Minister), the Valdštejnský palác (Wallenstein Palace, home of the Czech Senate), and a host of international embassies and other political buildings of interest.
It's the birthplace of the [Czech National Revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_National_Revival), and possibly the most picturesque city district in all of Europe. It's very beautiful overall and you really can't go wrong just wandering around there. If you were to see one area of Prague only, it might as well be Malá Strana.

Here are some highlights:

### Senate Gardens & Stakov Academy Gardens

You can enter the secluded [gardens of Wallenstein Palace](https://prague.eu/en/objevujte/wallenstein-garden-valdstejnska-zahrada/) without entry fee. 
The gardens are beautiful and feature free-roaming peacocks and a very unusual dripstone wall.
In summertime there are often outdoor theatre and concert events in the gardens' amphitheatre (concerts are every Thursday in summer).

The nearby Stakov Academy gardens ([Zahrada Strakovy akademie](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahrada_Strakovy_akademie)) are open to the public every Saturday from 10:00-18:00. The grounds and building have been recently renovated and are very beautiful.

### Prague Castle

The [**Prague Castle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Castle) is huge and full of beautiful, interesting things to see (including the Toy Museum, Alchemists’ Tour, and Golden Lane.)
Entrance is free, but there are a number of guided tours that can be taken.
In the center of the Castle area is the [St. Vitus Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vitus_Cathedral), which has its own very extensive and interesting history.
You can visit the inside of the cathedral at certain times, for paid or free (limited) access, or for religious services (nightly 'whispers').
[Info and hours here](https://www.katedralasvatehovita.cz/)

We typically take guests through the rear entrance via the northeast steps near Malostranská metro station for a “backwards” tour of the castle, exiting out to Nerudova street.

The castle is beautiful at night. There is a great restaurant hidden away inside behind the cathedral, [Vikárka Restaurant](http://vikarkarestaurant.cz/), but it closes early. Otherwise, if you exit out the main gate, just across the square is  [Kuchyň](https://kuchyn.ambi.cz/en), which is fantastic restaurant with great terrace views. 

![Stairs up to the back of the castle](/assets/img/blog/pragueguide/prazkyhrad_mapy@0,5x.png)  
*Stairs up to the back of the castle*

#### Petřín Hill & Strahov Monastery

Less than 1km to the south of the Prague Castle is Petřín hill. Petřín is home to a very large park and garden, a chapel and large tower on one side, and a monastery, cathedral, beautiful library and brewery on the other.

You can either [walk past the main Castle entrance](https://www.google.cz/maps/dir/Prague+Castle,+Prague+1/Strahov+Monastery,+Strahovsk%C3%A9+n%C3%A1dvo%C5%99%C3%AD+1%2F132,+118+00+Praha+1/@50.0887748,14.3956118,17z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x470b951e6c24b7c3:0x2acf3c88af12259f!2m2!1d14.3995792!2d50.0902163!1m5!1m1!1s0x470b936721e269bb:0xcf35623df3761af0!2m2!1d14.3892515!2d50.0861478!3e2?hl=en) at Hradčanské náměstí or up Nerudova to head to the Monastery and library, or you can [take the funicular](http://www.prague.net/funicular) up the south-eastern side of the hill up to the tower and observatory area.

If you're up to it you can [climb the 300 steps](https://www.pragueexperience.com/places.asp?PlaceID=604) up the tower to get a 360-degree view of Prague (~$6 fee). We've done it once, it was cool. Probably wouldn't make my list of "must do in Prague," but it will give you a good panaroma and some exercise.

If you like museums you should check out the [Strahovská Knihovna](https://www.strahovskyklaster.cz/en/strahov-library) (Strahov Library) (~$6 fee). It's well worth it. They have a funky collection of various interesting and also bizarre objects from antiquity. There is also the Basilica of the Assumption there, a very nice chapel.

If you're in that area, you can head to the [Strahov Monastery Brewery](https://www.klasterni-pivovar.cz/) for a beer and a meal. Get a reservation ahead if you're a big party, and ask to sit outside if the weather's nice.

#### Kampa

Kampa is a beautiful park just below the Charles Bridge with beautiful river views, several statues and other sights. The [Kampa Museum of Modern Art](https://www.museumkampa.cz/) is a great museum - you can go up to the roof patio on the rear side for some interesting views. The [Werichova villa](https://www.werichovavila.cz/) there has a great cafe that offers fancy brunch and desserts. Just north of Kampa is a funny little museum, the [Karl Zeman Museum](https://muzeumkarlazemana.cz/), which features interactive exhibits paying homage to the renowned Czech cinematographer and pioneer of visual effects.

#### Střelecký Island

If you take the stairs down to Střelecký ostrov from the Legií bridge, and sit on the north shore of the island, you can get a very beautiful view of the Charles Bridge at sunset. Don't feed the invasive nutria like the rest of the tourists.

![Sunset view of Charles Bridge from Střelecký Island](/assets/img/blog/pragueguide/streleckyostrov.png)  
[*Střelecký ostrov*](https://www.google.com/maps/search/St%C5%99eleck%C3%BD+ostrov/@50.0808266,14.4102779,17z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)

#### Národní divadlo (National theatre)  

One of the world’s most beautiful theatres. If you plan in advance, it's worth it to see just about anything that's playing there just to have the experience of seeing the theatre. If you're going to the opera, you _ought to_ wear formal attire, but you'll see tourists in t-shirts anyway 😞 There are often last-minute tickets available if you're willing to stand in the upper balcony.

Directly across the street is [Cafe Slavia](https://www.cafeslavia.cz/en/), a very nice, very traditional Czech cafe.

Just across the river from the theatre is the island [Slovanský ostrov](https://prague.eu/cs/objevujte/slovansky-ostrov/). Behind the beautiful Žofín Palace, you can get a drink (or a _very_ fancy meal) at the [Žofín Restaurant](https://www.zofinrestaurant.cz/en/), whose garden has a view of the front facade of the theatre.

## Old Town & Surroundings  

### Old Town Square (“Staroměstské náměstí”)  

The Old Town Square, Staroměstské náměstí, is usually packed with tourists by day. You can try walking through early in the morning, or visit late on weekdays for smaller crowds. Typically I don't spend much time there, it's a beautiful area but the square itself and its direct surroundings have become over-touristy.

The nearby [Jewish Museum](https://www.jewishmuseum.cz/en/info/visit/) is definitely worth a visit.

### Václavské náměstí  

St. Wenceslas Square, Václavské náměstí, is the beautiful, historic, now packed and touristy, boulevard leading up to the National Museum.
Václavské náměstí is an important site of cultural and historical significance -- a common gathering place of the Czech people during significant national events (*see image below*).

A visit to the National Museum is worth it just to see the inside of the building. If you do go, take the elevator to the top of the dome for a very cool city view.

## Various Other Spots

### Letná,  Stromovka, Troja

Letna is a large park on a hill north of Prague 1 on the far side of the river. There is a nice beer garden where you can grab a picnic table or two and have a drink and some finger food while looking across the river at all of Prague - the view is pretty incredible on a nice day. Highly recommended if the weather is nice and you want to take a walk through a beautiful park and have a beer (in a plastic cup) with a great view.

In the Letna area is the [National Technical Musuem](https://www.ntm.cz/en) and adjacent it, the [National Museum of Agriculture](https://www.nzm.cz/en), both very nice and worth seeing. Kids typically enjoy both museums.

![Location of the Letná beer garden](/assets/img/blog/pragueguide/letnamap.png)
> *the park is large - the beer garden is here*

Just north of Letna is the wonderful, very large park, "Stromovka" (Královská obora Stromovka). Stromovka is an excellent place for running, walking, or bike rides. There are several nice bistros within the park ([Bistro No.2](http://www.bistrono2.cz/) is a nice, casual, outddoor hang out spot.)

Further north, across the river and past "Ceaser's Island" (Císařský Ostrov) is the [Prague Zoo](https://www.zoopraha.cz/).

There is also a very nice cycling route that carries on past the Zoo and goes north along the river quite a ways. If you're clever you can even connect it the cycling route with ferry terminals to cross the river with your bike.

### Vyšehrad  

A historic fort overlooking the Vltava river.
It contains possibly the oldest remaining structure in Prague (Rotunda of St. Martin); a beautiful cathedral; and a cemetery which is home to the remains of a number of very famous Czechs including Dvořák, Smetana and Mucha.
It provides an excellent view of Prague from a direction you won't see if you spend all your time in the center and on the castle-side of the river.

There are several pubs within the fort walls (I like [Na Hradbach](https://www.na-hradbach.cz/)), and a huge park great for picnics which is full of beautiful statues. I highly recommend you check it out if you're close. A trip there could be connected to a visit to the nearby Naplavka.

### Naplavka

Riverside embankment with boats, bars, live music, and a Saturday farmers’ market (until ~1 pm).  

![Naplavka riverbank scene](/assets/img/blog/pragueguide/naplavka.png)  
*Naplavka area. Cute farmers market on Saturdays*

### Botanická Zahrada (Botanical Garden)  

Not the most amazing botanical garden in the world, but very nice nonetheless. There is a cool pub in the back: [Mrtvá Ryba](https://www.facebook.com/Mrtv%C3%A1-ryba-187716801292837/).

## Pubs, Restaurants & Cafés I Like  

I have an extensive Google Maps list you can subscribe to: [Food & Drinks Prague](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wFg3TKV2FF6FFQVR8).
{:.lead}

Here are some highlights of the list, places I really like:


- [Kuchyň](https://kuchyn.ambi.cz/en) – fantastic restaurant just outside the Prague Castle. They serve traditional Czech cuisine (among other things) but in a gourmet way, for a fair price. Fantastic Pilsner. If you get a reservation on the terrace the view is incredible.

- [Vikárka Restaurant](http://vikarkarestaurant.cz/) - A great, classic restaurant/pub hidden behind the cathedral within the castle grounds. It closes early, and you might need a reservation.

- [Lokál U Bílého kuželky](http://lokal-ubilekuzelky.ambi.cz/en/) – Prague 1/Malostrana – Cool Pilsner pub with good food. Casual and classic. Very close to the Charles bridge (3 minutes from the Malostrana side.) A reservation is probably a good idea.

- [Malostranská Beseda](http://www.malostranska-beseda.cz/en/about-beseda/history.html) – Prague 1/Malostrana – an extremely well draught Pilsner and a beautiful, historical restaurant/pub. You can sit outside on the street below the castle and in front of St. Nicholas Church, or, you can go inside (if so then we recommend downstairs in the cellar!). Good beer, good food. Classic place.

- [Strahov Monastery Brewery](http://www.klasterni-pivovar.cz/pivovar/pivo_sv_norbert) – see Strahov section above.

- [U Fleku](http://en.ufleku.cz/) – I usually wouldn't actually recommend this, it's very touristy. But it's an interesting experience nonetheless.

- [Restaurace Mincovna](https://www.restauracemincovna.cz/) – Prague 1 / Old Town – I typically wouldn't recommend looking for a restaurant adjacent to Old Town Square, but if you're there, Mincovna is a great option. Good food (fancy twist on traditional Czech) and a decent Pilsner. Prices are acceptable (better than most other places of this quality in Old Town Square.)

- [Červený jelen](http://cervenyjelen.cz) – very good restaurant near the city center

- [Vinohradský Parlament Restaurant](http://www.vinohradskyparlament.cz/) - Great restaurant which specializes in "knedlíky" (Czech dumplings.) Everything on the menu is usually very good.

- [La Degustation Bohême Bourgeoise](https://www.ladegustation.cz/) – only (one of few?) Michelin star rated restaurant in Prague. It will be amazing, and expensive.

- [La Degustation](http://www.ladegustation.cz/) - Upscale, very good, near the city center.

- [Nejen Bistro](http://nejenbistro.cz/) – Prague 3 / Karlin – slightly more pricey but very nice bistro with fancy takes on classic dishes and some unique dishes of their own.

- [Eska Restaurant](http://eska.ambi.cz/en/) – Prague 3 / Karlin – Quite pricey, but very good small plate restaurant (cool, super hip, ever-more gentrified area east of Old Town). Great wine selection, almost all local/Czech goods.

- [Zlý Časy](http://www.zlycasy.eu/) – 25 min. from the center of downtown, but close if you find yourself near I.P. Pavlova or Vyšehrad. An old haunt and personal favorite.

- [Kulový blesk](http://www.restauracekulovyblesk.cz/) – (Prague 1 closer to Prague 4) – great pub with great food, always more than 10 beers on tap. Make a reservation!

- [První Pivní Tramway](http://www.prvnipivnitramway.cz/) - best pub in Prague.
