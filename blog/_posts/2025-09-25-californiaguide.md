This is another highly opinionated list of tourism suggestions. I'm often asked, mostly by Europeans, for recommendations for traveling to California, so here they are.

> [!Work in progress]
> This post is largely unfinished but I needed to share at least something with some friends.

**Quick links to highlights:**

- "I have one day in San Francisco, what should I do?"
- [Golden Gate Park Half-Day Tour](#golden-gate-park-half-day-tour)

## Central Coast

When I say "Central Coast" I'm referring to the Santa Cruz, Aptos, Monterey, Pacific Grove, Carmel, Big Sur area. The short story is: this stretch of coastline is gorgeous. Simply driving down CA-1 to Big Sur and back is a wonderful thing to do in California and I strongly recommend it. Or, make a 2-3 day trip out of visiting some beautiful Northern California coastal towns and some outdoors-oriented sights in between.
## Monterey Bay Area

Take a drive down past Monterey Bay. Stay in Pacific Grove. Walk the Asilomar trail. Rent a bike and ride 17 Mile Drive. Spend 3 hours at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Drive down to Big Sur. Spend a day at Andrew Molera State Beach. Drive the scenic Highway 1 to Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Beach and see McWay Falls. Hike up the Big Sur River Gorge trail and swim in the pools at the top.

- [Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Beach & McWay Falls](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=578)

## Santa Cruz

A few things I can recommend doing in and around Santa Cruz:

- Natural Bridges
- Davenport Landing Beach
- Panther Beach
- Steamer Lane
- Pleasure Point
- Capitola
- Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park

### 💡Santa Cruz Day-Trip Ideas

#### Half-day Tour through Santa Cruz

Spend half a day around Santa Cruz en route down south to Big Sur:

- Go to Natural Bridges, park and walk down to sit on the beach
- Drive along West Cliff Drive
- Stop at Steamer Lane and get out and watch the surfers
- Take the long route along the water past Seabright Beach and Twin Lakes to Pleasure Point
- Try to park somewhere along East Cliff Drive to get out and watch the surfers at Pleasure Point
- Go to 41st Avenue, get some stickers at the surf and skate shops (Santa Cruz Boardroom, O'Neill) and a coffee at Verve.
- Go to Capitola, get a slice of pizza, walk around.


## Santa Cruz Mountains

As this list is autobiographical and highly opinionated, my focus on the Santa Cruz mountains is pretty isolated to the area between the South Bay Area and Santa Cruz, although the Santa Cruz mountains range all the way from San Francisco to south of Gilroy & Watsonville.

Hiking in the Santa Cruz mountains is wonderful. You can experience the various microclimates of Northern California, walk amongst giant [coastal redwoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens), see views of both the San Francisco Bay Area and the Monterey Bay Area coastline, and experience the beautiful fragrant bouquet of California's amazing flora.

Below are some personal hiking recommendations.

For a bigger challenge, check out the [Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyline-to-the-Sea_Trail), a 29.5-mile (47.5 km) trail that goes from the top of the hills just outside of the South Bay Area to exit on the coast at Waddell Beach. The trail can be done via two moderate days of hiking with an overnight along the trail, or it can be run in a single day. *Note*: make **sure** you check conditions if you plan this - many trail sections are still being recovered after the [CZU Lightning Complex fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CZU_Lightning_Complex_fires "CZU Lightning Complex fires"))
### [Big Basin](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=540)

California's oldest state park. Home to giant California Coastal Redwoods and many beautiful trails. In 2020, lightning started a fire that drastically changed the shape of the park. Although nearly all old-growth redwoods survived, all historic structures did not. See [info brochure with map](https://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/540/files/BigBasinRedwoodsSP_Infosheet_8.5x14_011525_FINAL.pdf).

For an easy, short hike, simply visit the old park headquarters area and try the "Redwood Loop Trail"

For a moderate, longer hike, try the  **[Ocean View Summit Loop](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=28975)**. Have a look at the [All Trails map](https://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/540/files/BigBasinRedwoodsSP_Infosheet_8.5x14_011525_FINAL.pdf) for reference but please note that AllTrails is often not up-to-date with trail closures. Always check at the official park information and talk to the park staff to know what the current trail conditions are!
### [Castle Rock](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=538)

Castle Rock is a beautiful park with several trails, beautiful views all the way to the Monterey Bay, and includes a host of interesting rock formations that are open to climbing.

For an easy hike, simply follow the "**Castle Rock Nature Trail**" to Castle Rock itself (the rock formation and namesake of the park).

For a more intensive hike, check out the **Saratoga Gap** and **Ridge Loop** trails.

If you're resourceful, you might even find the nearby personal favorite of mine, Aquarian Valley, which is much less known than Castle Rock itself, but also has some wonderful climbing with a great hike-in approach.

### [Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=546)

Closer to Santa Cruz itself is the smaller Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. The park has a campground with overnight camping options, old growth redwood groves, the "Garden of Eden" swimming hole, and several nice trails.
### [Sierra Azul Preserve](https://www.openspace.org/preserves/sierra-azul)

Closer to the San Jose side of the South Bay Area, just outside of Los Gatos, is the massive Sierra Azul Preserve. The preserve climbs out over the Lexington Reservoir to overlook the South Bay Area. On clear days, hikers can see the entire San Francisco Bay Area, from Almaden all the way to South San Francisco and across the bay to Oakland. The preserve has a different landscape than the more densely forested Big Basin area parks; it features more of the dry, high grasslands with strands of California Bay and oak.

If you're up for a big hike, you can climb the 1200 feet across 8 miles to reach the Mount Umunhum summit. It will likely take over 4 hours. Bring **lots** of water. OpenSpace Preserves [official map](https://www.openspace.org/sites/default/files/Um_Trail_map_0.pdf), and [AllTrails Map](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/mount-umunhum).


### Rancho San Antonio

Further up the peninsula, in the North San Francisco Bay Area just outside of Los Altos, is [**Rancho San Antonio County Park**](https://parks.santaclaracounty.gov/locations/rancho-san-antonio-county-park) and **[Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve](https://www.openspace.org/preserves/rancho-san-antonio)**. The preserve is very large and contains several wonderful hikes. The "High Meadow Loop" is a popular hike that provides a wonderful view out over the Bay Area from its peak.

For a very easy, very kid-friendly activity, check out the Deer Hollow Farm Trail.

For a longer hike, connect the Coyote Trail loop, Upper High Meadow trail, and Stephen E Arbors Loop for an [8.5 mile hike](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/coyote-upper-high-meadow-and-stephen-e-arbors-loop) covering a large area of the preserve.

If you're a runner, the trails here are all very runner-friendly. The Stephen E Arbors trail (formerly "PG&E Trail") is a great trail with a hard, consistent climb. Here's a [Strava Map](https://www.strava.com/routes/3389567243545654852) I made for it. Here's an [example run](https://www.strava.com/activities/9713507337): 15KM exactly, with almost 500m elevation.

### [Hidden Villa](https://www.hiddenvilla.org/)

Just up the road from Rancho is [Hidden Villa](https://www.hiddenvilla.org/), which also contains many nice hikes and a series of engaging, educational activities for kids.


## San Francisco

This section is best-effort. I can't say I've spent enough time in the city to give expert advice on what to do there. Still, I don't want you hanging out around the Financial District the whole time so I'll do my best.

## Golden Gate Park

Golden Gate Park is massive. Golden Gate Park is awesome. Go hang out in Golden Gate Park. If you come back to Europe and complain about San Francisco being dirty or crowded and all you did was go to Union Square, the Financial District, and the Embarcadero, and you *didn't* spend any time in Golden Gate Park: boo 👎😞 **shame on you**.

## 💡SF Day-Trip Ideas
