More details on Obsidian and why I love this coming soon. For now, just a quick post to make sure these setup steps get captured, because I spent too long using too many misleading guides before I figured this out. 

## How to setup Obsidian to sync as GitHub repository including iOS device sync

1. Create repository on GitHub and initialize it with a README.md
2. Clone repo on desktop device using https and ghb private access token (must be classic token), e.g.: `https://ghp_<token>@github.com/<user-name>/<repo>.git`
	3. suggest making a test commit & push to remote to ensure it's working, then `git fetch` back to local on pc
3. Launch Obsidian app on desktop, open vault and select the git repository location
4. Enable community plugins, install Obsidian-git, enter author name name and author email (use the do-not-reply github email). 
5. Do a test `commit-and-sync` in the Obsidian-git panel to validate
6. Install Obsidian on iOS, create a new local vault. Vault name is unimportant, the purpose is to initialize the `On My iPhone/Obsidian/` directory in iOS Files.  
7. Copy the repository folder from desktop to iOS device to `On My iPhone/Obsidian/<repo>` (I created the initializing Obsidian vault with the same name, "notes", and used `replace` when copying there)
8. Launch iOS Obsidian app
9. Go to Setting > Community Plugins. Enable Community Plugins. Install Obsidian Git. 
10. Enter GitHub username & Personal Access Token (use the same one from step 2)
11. You should see status messages that your repo is synced
12. Navigate to your README.me, make a test edit and use the git panel (swipe left from right side of screen), make a test `commit-and-push`.
