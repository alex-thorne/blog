# Kola 2024

Every year I go on a cycling tour with some friends here in the Czech Republic. I'm posting this year's tour for posterity and as a way of cataloging the route, which I think worked out very well in the end. 

## Route

This crew hadn't ridden along the river Berounka together yet, so this year we worked out well and only required us to take a pretty short train ride for the start of the journey since Prague and Plzen are so well connected.

We significantly altered any of the would-be standard routes to two connect these two cities. We adjusted our route to favor trails and avoid roads where possible, and also made sure it went past some specific points of interest (mostly local breweries.)

There were several final detours or further alterations of the below route which I failed to fully capture. All in all we rode a bit over 200km over 4 days. Quite relaxed really, even with the packed bags and some of the more extended climbs. This year the biggest challenge was the 32°C/90°F weather.

## Some background

What really sets this particular yearly tour apart for me is this crew's insistence on only ever 'wild camping.' This is always viable largely due to the fact that we're always in the Czech Republic on our tours. Even in the extremely rare cases where we were approached for sleeping somewhere someone felt we shouldn't, the confrontation was extremely mild. There just isn't the same fear that such a confrontations would escalate. I'm not sure I will ever feel as comfortable doing that for example in the United States.

I love this wild camping approach for the flexibility it allows on the daily schedule (or lack of one). I also love it that we never carry tents, just a small tarp to use as a shelter if needed and a ground layer. Most of us have something like this [Sea to Summit tarp/poncho](https://seatosummit.eu/en-cz/products/nylon-tarp-poncho) and a small folded sheet of [Tyvek](https://www.dupont.com/brands/tyvek.html) as a ground layer. Both together, with some light cording for guy-lines should cost you less than $75 and takes up very little space.


## Highlights

I didn't take a camera, just the phone, and just snapped a few pics. Here's a couple:

We slept on the bank of Berounka, somewhere between Chrást and Břasy. It rained during the night, I was slow to set up a shelter and got pretty soaked. I chose not to bring a sleeping bag, just a small blanket, which was also soaked, so it wasn't the greatest night. But, this 05:45 shot came out nice!

A good chunk of the trails on this route looked something like this. Very nice riding.

Better weather on the next night, this shot captures the "pod širákem" (sleeping under the stars) wild camping style of this crew.

One final bonus selfie. Sunscreen is important, ya'll!
