## Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow

I read Team Topologies when a colleague began regularly referring to the "team types" outlined there (e.g., "enabling team").

Overall I like the book. It's accessible and concise. The overall concept to team/organizational models Skelton and Pais describe align largely with my own ideals. The concepts described are cohesive and easy to follow, and at this point most of our team has read the book, so we can use the terminology as a shared vocabularly to make our thoughts on organizational modeling easier to relay (concepts like Stream-Aligned, Platform, Enabling, and Complicated-Subsystem).

The topic of a team's cognitive load I find particularly interesting. It's an issue essentially every team I've worked with has faced eventually. Of course the "fracture planes" described there are simple in nature (front-end, back-end. ). I was wishing of course that the book would magically solve that problem for me, or at least give me some "aha!" moment to see our invisible fracture planes more clearly. Wishful thinking.

I wanted to write more on the book, but I haven't gotten around to it, and it's been a while, so I'm just finishing this listing as is instead.

Just read it, it's quick, it's insightful, it'll give you a concise method of describing these concepts which your colleagues will quickly understand and hopefuly adapt.
