## A People’s History of the United States

A fantastic work and well worth reading. It's accessible and easy to read, offering many interesting insights into a broad range of American history. I especially appreciate Zinn's epilogue and his remarks on the concept of "objectivity" in relation to works of history and political science.

In the afterword, Zinn provides a list of additional reading related to Latino and Chicano peoples' struggles in California and the US Southwest, which helps augment his largely East Coast personal focus. These are now on my reading list:

* [De Colores Means All of Us](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549080/de-colores-means-all-of-us-by-elizabeth-martinez/) — by [Elizabeth Martínez](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/2143774/elizabeth-martinez/)
* [Zapata's Disciple](http://www.martinespada.net/zapatas-disciple.html) — by Martín Espada
* [Aztlan and Viet Nam](https://www.ucpress.edu/books/aztlan-and-viet-nam/paper) — Chicano and Chicana Experiences of the War, edited by [George Mariscal](https://www.ucpress.edu/books/browse?q=George+Mariscal#paginated-list)
