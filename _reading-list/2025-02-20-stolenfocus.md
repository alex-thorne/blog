## Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention— and How to Think Deeply Again

Good book, would recommend reading. I've largely turned away from the "Self Help" genre of reading for many years. Too much of it feels like I'm being sold something. Not enough of it feels scientific. Maybe I was just bored of it. I read Johann Hari's _Stolen Focus_ on the recommendation of a family member. It didn't feel like self-help as much as it did an exploration into a specific topic. Nothing in particular in the book feels groundbreaking or revolutionary. It looks at the concepts of focus and attention in the context of our modern world from various angles. Hari makes his research on various related aspects of what affects our focus accessible to the reader, with each topic feeling like a well-linked part of a larger cohesive investigation.

For me personally, the book aligned perfectly with my existing interest in reducing distraction and focusing on fewer topics, more deeply - something I'd felt I needed to get back under control over the last couple of years.

It's a quick read and there are some anecdotes I assume most people would find interesting such as Aza Raskin and his reflections on Infinite Scroll and Tristan Harris and his [call to Minimize Distraction & Respect Users’ Attention](https://archive.org/details/378841682-a-call-to-minimize-distraction-respect-users-attention-by-tristan-harris) while working at Google. Worth reading if you're interested in the subject; just be careful: it may make you want to delete your Facebook account and throw your phone away.
