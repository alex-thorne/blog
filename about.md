### About me

My name is Alex Thorne, I'm a California-raised US citizen living in Europe for the past 15 years. I like music, running, cycling, surfing, board games, hiking, camping, traveling, language, literature, art, woodworking, and plenty of other stuff (I'm allowed to contain multitudes, ok?!)

For the last ten years I've been working as an IT Operations Manager in the Commodities & Power Trading sphere. Lately I've been challenging myself to take on more personal projects in the area general area of DevOps. This site is not only a platform to showcase those projects' journeys, but a project itself.

I'll also use this little site as a place to share links to various other interests of mine (check out [The Pork Chop Express]{:.heading.flip-title}!)
