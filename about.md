### About me

Hi, I'm Alex. I grew up in California and have been living in Europe for the past 15 years. I like technology, writing, music, running, cycling, surfing, board games, hiking, camping, traveling, language, literature, art, woodworking, etc. etc. etc.

I run a small (mid-size?) software development company that provides trading services in the energy commodities market sphere. A couple years ago I needed a space to share some content with friends, so I put this site up. I also intend to use this site as a place to share links to various other interests of mine.
