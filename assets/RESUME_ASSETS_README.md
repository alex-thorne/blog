# Resume Assets - Currently Not in Use

The following resume-related assets are preserved in this directory but are currently not being used on the blog site:

- `Resume.pdf` - PDF version of resume
- `resume.json` - JSON resume data
- `img/headshot-resume.jpg` - Resume headshot image

These files are kept for potential future re-addition. The resume page (`/resume.md`) has been unpublished by setting `published: false` in its front matter.

To re-enable the resume:
1. Edit `/resume.md` and remove the `published: false` line
2. Uncomment the Resume menu item in `/_config.yml`
3. Uncomment the resume references in `/index.md` and `/about.md`
