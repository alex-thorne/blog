## #chuckstuff Project

### Some history on this project
Over the last several years I've interviewed hundres of candidates for DevOps engineering positions in our department. We developed a method of evaluating canidates which included asking them to complete a small assignment so we use it to assess their skills in IaC related concepts as well as base our follow up interview discussion on their project choices. 

This year we reorganized our department, and several of my colleagues and I branched off to form a new section focused on several new greenfield products. Hiring into the new section is a key topic for us at the moment, so I've been reflecting on the hiring experience I had in the former teams over the last 8 years. I've been trying to decide if asking candidates to complete an assignment like this is still a worthwhile approach, or whether we should refactor the process. 

If we do use an assignment like this, it will need to change a bit, not only because AI-powered tools make it easier and easier to spoof a such an assignment, but also to incorporate some of the updated skills we'll need in the new teams. Either to hand it over to the new hiring managers taking my place, or at least to capture its history before it dies, I decided to better document the process. 

I also couldn't stop thinking that, throughout the years I'd asked so many candidates to do this assignment although I'd never actually completed it myself.

So, without further ado, I submit for evaluation #[chuckstuff](https://github.com/alex-thorne/take-home-assignment): my devops engineer application takehome assignment.
