 Because who needs a fancy social media add powered service for this, really?

I used to use another popular social media site for tracking the books I wanted to read. I don't do that anymore. Here is my reading list. 

fun fact: I formatted this via a dirty copy-paste of highlighted text from the site I used to use, and asked copilot to form that text block as a markdown table, including adding the books title's as hyperlinks, linking to the url's of the publishers' own pages for the titles. Took about 3 minutes to put this page up.

### Coming soon: reviews.
