  Because who needs a fancy, ad-powered social media service for this, really?

These are not book reviews. They are logs of what I am reading and have read.

The primary purpose of this collection is to serve as a personal log.  
Another purpose is to share what I'm currently interested in with anyone who might be interested themselves.

I started putting this log here when I decided I'd had enough of ad-powered services and social media platforms but wanted somewhere else to capture what I'm reading and want to read next.

Individual posts might contain notes on why I decided to read that work, what I thought about it, or the impact it had on me at the time.
